4] Now we will format namenode by using command (hdfs namenode -format)

5] Now we will start all commands in hadoop by using command(start-all.cmd)

6] Now Enter Path (C: hadoop\sbin) as given below:

7] Now open browser and type localhost:9870 and locathost:8088 to open hadoop.

8] Now we will create a folder and in that folder we will create a (.txt) file and enter data into it.

9] Now we will go again to cmd and type some commands:
i) we will create input file in hadoop
ii) Now we will insert our data.txt file into input directory
ili) Now to check the data in data.txt file:
iv) Now to implement word count program type command:
(C:\hadoop\sbin>hadoop jar C:/hadoop/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-
mapreduce-examples-3.3.3.jar wordcount /input /output) and Click Enter.

To get path go to C:/hadoop/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-3.3.3.jar

Now choose last file and copy file name:
